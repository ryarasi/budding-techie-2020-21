Although the home page says introduction, it doesn't really introduce the website to the user. It speaks more about the Angor Wat temple. <p><br /><p>The use of iframe to include the videos hosted within Google Drive was not taught as part of the course.

    Remarks:
      "<p>The website is not only coherent but also is highly utilitarian in that it supports the contestant's need to have a website to support their YouTube channel. <p><br /><p>In terms of complexity, the site is fairly complex. It has different pages and different kinds of content within it, some taught in class and some not. <p><br /><p>In terms of creativity, there is a lot of small creative touches that highlight creative use of the coding skills. For instance, the little emoji on the home page and the animations at the bottom of some of the other pages etc offer a nice touch, other than the images and videos embedded throughout the page. The use of favicon is also noteworthy.<p><br /><p>Many of the features included here weren't touched upon in the course. For instance, the use of favicon, the use of animations, the use of emojis in the page etc. And also it has to be noted that the student was quite active throughout the course in actively communicating and clearing theiir doubts. There was a display of enthusiasm for learning and applying new concepts.<p><br /><p>In terms of originality, as noted earlier, a practical thought process behind the choice of topic can be observed and the contestent definitely has used the knowldge gained in the course and applied it in a practical real world context. However, the layout of each page is not very different from what was taught in the course. Some of the concepts regarding content and layout of the page are utilized directly from the course content.<p><br /><p>The code is quite clean. The HTML and CSS files are formatted for readability, No unused code blocks were found. Overall, the code qaulity appeared to be high, certainly above average.</p>",

Some of the pages have custom background.The amount of content is also quite modest.<p><br /><p>The project does seem to be coherent and stick to the core topic, but there is very little display of innovative use of what was learned in the course. Some of the images used appear to be screenshots rather than original images, which is not aesthetically appealing because of the distracting elements in the images. The video included is not really relevant to what the website is about. <p><br /><p>As noted earlier, nothing aside from what was taught as part of the course is included in the project. <p><br /><p>A lot of unused code is left in both the HTML and CSS files.

As to whether the choice of topic is engaging or interesting is another matter. But for the topic chosen, there could be additional context offered in terms of how the dry details could have been presented. For instance, the page could have spoken about the reason why this particular vehicle is special and warrants a page of itself and some text describing what's special about it rather than just specification details.<p><br /><p>The code is neither optimized for mobile display nor is it formatted for readability.

The number of pages, the use of media etc. are appropriate enough to accomodate the goal of the website, which is commendable.<p><br /><p>In terms of presentation, some improvements could have been welcome. Even though the text is not unreadable, the heavy use of background and tightly packed text content make it difficult to read. A little more space between the text, better use of color scheme could have made the content more readable.<p><br /><p>The use of tiled images was not taught in the class.<p><br /><p>Overall there is an appreciable amount of originality in how the HTML/CSS knowledge was used for a practical and focused application. It demonstrates that the student knows how to apply what they know. <p><br /><p>The code quality is not great. The code is not formatted for readability and there is some amount of repetition in the CSS code used in the various files, which could have been avoided with the use of multiple external CSS files. The content could have been presented in a way that highlights all the various sections.

External code/content is used without having removed unnecessary content. For instance, in the home page we can see a block of details that still has some links that don't go anywhere. These could have been removed. The code also includes some external stylesheets that don't add much. The contact page looks different from the rest of the pages, which doesn't look well integrated. The nav bar at the top is missing in the contact page, which is also not helpful. The notes on what each image is also so small that it is not easy to see it.

The site does incorporate a lot of things that an actual website would require.<p><br /><p>The registration and login pages are something that an actual website would require and it indicates that definitely some work was involved in learning outside the course. <p><br /><p>The code quality is quite poor. There are some mistakes in the code and also it hasn't been formatted for readability. <p><br /><p>Overall, this is one of the more strange submissions but still it can be observed that a lot of work has gone into it.</p>",
